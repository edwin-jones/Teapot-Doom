Teapot-Doom
===========

This is my own personal fork of Chocolate Doom for mucking about with C in.
It's entirely set up for Visual Studio Express 2013 and windows.
All files you need are included, the solution is in the msvc folder
and the doom demo iwad is in the wads folder. 

Changes include but are not limited to: insta-gibbing, limited X360 controller
support and grunts now drop better weapons - who wants to wait for a shotty?
